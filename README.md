# Data Analysis with R by IBM - Course Completion

## Overview
I am excited to share that I have successfully completed the **Data Analysis with R** course offered by **IBM**. This course provided me with a comprehensive understanding of how to perform data analysis using R, covering essential concepts and practical applications in statistical modeling, data visualization, and more.

## Course Topics
During the course, I gained proficiency in the following topics:
- Introduction to R programming
- Data wrangling and manipulation with R
- Data visualization using ggplot2
- Descriptive statistics and summary measures
- Hypothesis testing and inferential statistics
- Linear regression modeling
- Time series analysis
- Working with real-world datasets

## Tools & Libraries Used
Throughout the course, I worked extensively with:
- **RStudio**: Integrated development environment (IDE) for R programming.
- **tidyverse**: Collection of R packages for data science.
  - **ggplot2**: For creating elegant data visualizations.
  - **dplyr**: For data manipulation and transformation.
  - **tidyr**: For tidying data.
- **R**: For statistical analysis and computing.

## Projects and Assignments
Here are the assignments I completed during the course:

1. **Data Wrangling**  
   Cleaned and transformed raw datasets to make them analysis-ready using functions from the `dplyr` and `tidyr` packages.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data using summary statistics and visualizations with `ggplot2`.

3. **Data Acquisition using tidyverse**  
   Acquired and imported datasets from various sources, and manipulated them using functions from the `tidyverse` package.

4. **Model Development**  
   Built and evaluated statistical models, including linear regression, to make predictions and draw conclusions based on data.

5. **Model Evaluation and Refinement**  
   Assessed the performance of models and refined them using techniques such as cross-validation and residual analysis.

6. **Final Assignment**  
   Completed a capstone project where I applied all the skills learned in the course to solve a comprehensive data analysis problem.
